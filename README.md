# Distributed Graph Coloring using PySpark

This project implements a distributed graph coloring algorithm using **Apache Spark** with **PySpark**. Graph coloring is a classic problem in graph theory where each vertex of a graph is assigned a color such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

By leveraging the power of distributed computing with PySpark, this implementation can handle large-scale graphs that wouldn't fit in memory on a single machine.
